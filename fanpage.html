    <h1>Elton John Fan Page</h1>

    <p class="bio">
        Elton John's unique blend of pop and rock styles turned him into one of the 20th century's biggest music icons.
        He was musically gifted from a young age, and released his first self-titled American album in 1970,
        making him a huge international star.</p>
    <p class="bio">
        Some of his chart-topping hits include "Crocodile Rock," "Philadelphia Freedom" and "Candle in the Wind." 
        He also found success on Broadway, composing the score for Billy Elliot (2008),
        which went on to win 10 Tony Awards. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994
        and knighted in 1998.</p>
